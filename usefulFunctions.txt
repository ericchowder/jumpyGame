rb.useGravity = t/f; //if gravity is applied
rb.AddForce(x, y, z); //applies force to object
direction * Time.detlaTime; //changes applied to delta time as opposed to frames


FixedUpdate() instead of Update() for physics stuff


RigidBody - Is Kinematic: makes it only account for kinematics (no movement/gravity, only collision)
